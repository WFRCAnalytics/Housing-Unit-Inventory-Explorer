The location and types of existing housing stock are key inputs to WFRC's land use models that support forecasting where residents will live and work in the coming decades. Our household and jobs forecast, in turn, informs long range transportation and other planning.  

Version 2 of the Housing Inventory Explorer web map (developed using the ESRI Maps SDK for Javascript) is an update to the initial site which was released in early January 2022. The purpose of this tool is extend data the data that WFRC already prepares, to allow anyone to explore housing trends across the region – answering the general questions: 

- **What types of housing choices are available to Wasatch Front residents, generally, and in the city and town centers that local communities envision?**
- **How well does historic and recent housing development match with the locations where major public investments have already been made in transportation infrastructure (like transit and freeways) and other neighborhood amenities (parks, trails, etc)?**  

The Housing Inventory Explorer has a number of powerful tools to filter the housing inventory dataset and change how it is displayed/colored on the map. The filter and display controls are located on the sides of the map – the graphic below describes the maps buttons (circled in red) that are used to access various map tool.

The Housing Unit Explorer uses the most current regionwide data available. WFRC is coordinating with other entities, including MAG (for Utah County), in hopes of adding Utah County's urban areas.

Data Sources: **2022 Housing parcels**: Davis, Salt Lake, and Weber County Assessors via UGRC (unit count estimates for multifamily housing and grouping of housing with associated 'common areas' by WFRC); **Local Boundaries, Parks, Trails, Trailheads**: UGRC; **Wasatch Choice Centers**: WFRC; **Transit Stations**: UTA; **Freeway Exits** (UGRC, WFRC).
